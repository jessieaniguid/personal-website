            Flight of the Fire Fairy is a student game I worked on with friends during my final year of university. 
            It follows the story of Firena, a once high ranking fairy general who was unjustly clipped of her wings and thrown into fairy hell. 
            Players play as Firena and use her combat knowledge to beat enemies with various combos. 
            Once they get far enough, the player can regain Firena's wings and fly out of this hell to restore her honor.">
